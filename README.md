# RFLock(Radio Frequency lock)
This project aims to provide motorcycle owners with a simple and effective way to secure their bikes using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. By customizing the motorcycle key with RFID sensors and hiding an RFID module inside the motorcycle's panel, owners can easily unlock their motorbikes without the need for complicated passwords or keys.

# Features
- Miniature Representation: Displayed as a scaled-down version of a motorcycle speedometer at a ratio of 1:12.
- Customized Motorcycle Key: The motorcycle key is modified by inserting an RFID chip inside, allowing for RFID detection.
- Hidden RFID Module: An RFID module is concealed inside the motorcycle's panel for seamless integration.
- Key Switch: Resembles a real-life motorcycle key switch for intuitive operation.
# Technologies Used
- KiCad: Used to create schematic diagrams for the project.
- Blender: Utilized for creating 3D modeling of the product, aiding in visualization.
- NI Multisim: Checked voltage levels across components to ensure proper functionality.
- RFID Module: Utilized for detecting RFID sensors and enabling access control.

# How It Works
The system diagram relies on two primary data inputs: the standard key switch and the RFID sensor. When the standard key is turned, it activates the key switch. Simultaneously, the RFID sensor is triggered upon detecting its corresponding sensor within the modified motorcycle key. When the RFID sensor successfully detects its match, it triggers an AND gate, allowing the motorcycle to be turned on.
